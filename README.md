# Height Predictor Project

This project is a **Machine Learning model** to predict height based on input features. It includes the trained model, Python scripts, and sample code to run predictions.

## Project Structure

- `height_predictor_model.pkl` - Trained ML model  
- `heightpredict.py` - Script to predict height using the model  
- `mlmodel.py` - Code used to train the model  
- `sample.py` - Example usage / testing script  
- `venv/` - Python virtual environment (ignored in GitHub)

## Features

- Predict height based on numerical input features  
- Easy to use scripts for testing the model  
- Can be extended for more data or integrated into a web app  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/height_predict.git
